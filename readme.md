# Image Viewer (Lunaris edition)

Simple, easy to use, image rendering software. Do you hate Photos taking 923757329 years to load full res? Load once FULL RESOLUTION and zoom in and out almost infinite (you can see pixels as huge blocks if you really want that zoom, seriously)

The screen will be gray while loading.

This uses Lunaris.
